# 🏈 NFL Breakout Prediction (Logistic Regression)

A machine learning project predicting whether an NFL player will have a breakout season (0 = no, 1 = yes).  
This project focuses on data cleaning, feature preparation, scaling, and training a Logistic Regression classifier.

## 📊 Model Performance

**Accuracy:** 93%

**Confusion Matrix:**
[[32 3]
[[ 2 33]]

The model shows balanced precision and recall for both classes.
